    <h2>What did I learn | What did I struggle with</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning curve with GitHub page creation : It was my first time creating GitHub page.</li>
      <li>Creating folders and linking it with the nav bar was frustrating becuase I ran into some syntax errors.</li>
      <li>Despite the struggle, learning how to create a GitHub page was new experience that I enjoyed.</li>
      <li>I struggled with some css styling. I learned about templates from GitHub menual.</li>
      <li>Unlike visual studio code, GitHub takes time to refresh with changes. I figured it out later in my process of creating GitLab.</li>
