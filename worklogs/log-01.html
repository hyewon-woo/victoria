    <h1>Log 01 — Project Introuction</h1>
    <p><em>Date:</em> Feb 8, 2026</p>

    <h2>Project Proposal Draft</h2>
    <p>This project is continuition of my own project "readYou" from application development course at Whitworth University.
    readYou is a journaling web application designed to encourage users to journal regularly to allow daily reflection time for mental health.
    Current version of readYou allows user to submit journal, and recieve suggested music & coloring sheets from implemented APIs.
    However current version of readYou faces NLP challenges. It is unable to recognize sarcasm, dialectal or cultural expressions.
    Followed by its challenges with NLP, it is not able to provide fully personalized activity suggestions.</p>
    
    <P>Through this Project "readYou ver.2", I am intending to upgrade readYou more user friendly, user understanding, and user helpful application. 
    I am looking into creating mobile app version of readYou for better accessibility for users to take journal whenever and wherever.
    I am also hoping to intergrate NLP that is awware of sarcasm, dialects and cultural expressions to analyze journals better in order to provide fully personalized suggestions.
    In order to do so, Journal storage is the first thing to be nailed down, as long as frame work to develop mobile app for it.</P>

    <p>I am planning on using either Swift or Flutter to develop mobile app for readYou ver.2. To get expert's feedback, I Will be reaching out to Sarah Immel and Caterina Moruzzi from University of Edinburgh.
    Furthermore, I will be inputting my own journals on regular basis to develop a small case study using real user data.</p>
        
    <h2>What did I accomplish</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Created the GitHub website for the first time!</li>
      <li>Set up folder structure to upload work logs in html or md file.</li>
      <li>Created the nav bar to for home, worklogs and products.</li>
      <li>Drafted tentative project proposal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What did I learn | What did I struggle with</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning curve with GitHub page creation : It was my first time creating GitHub page.</li>
      <li>Creating folders and linking it with the nav bar was frustrating becuase I ran into some syntax errors.</li>
      <li>Despite the struggle, learning how to create a GitHub page was new experience that I enjoyed.</li>
      <li>I struggled with some css styling. I learned about templates from GitHub menual.</li>
      <li>Unlike visual studio code, GitHub takes time to refresh with changes. I figured it out later in my process of creating GitLab.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Next steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>CSS styling for worklogs and products page.</li>
      <li>Explore more into differnt templates to apply-> modify index.md for template.</li>
      <li>Last semester, I was interacting with Caterina Mouzzi and Sarah Immel from University of Edinburgh, mainly talking about ethical AI and NLP. I plan on reaching out to them to get feedbacks for this continued project.</li>
      <li>Details of projects are to come through.</li>
    </ul>
